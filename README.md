# Annotation of Multiword Expressions
Brynna Kilcline, Gabby Masini, Ruth Rosenblum, and Annika Sparrell

The goal of this project is to identify and categorize all multiword expressions
(MWEs) in the data. We define a multiword expression as a string of multiple words
which act as a single semantic or syntactic element. The annotated data will become
training data for a machine learning model that will identify different types of MWEs in text,
which is useful for downstream tasks in which they should be treated as single units, such as machine 
translation, translation detection, synonym detection, and syntactic parsing.

We iteratively annotated, evaluated, and revised the annotation guidelines. This repository includes 
each version of the specification and guidelines as well as the initial and revised document type definitions (DTDs). 
For information on the data, annotation task, and results, please see the final paper.
