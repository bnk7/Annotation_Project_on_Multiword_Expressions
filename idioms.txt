lickety split
lie back and think of england
light at the end of the tunnel
live long and prosper
living the dream
life of riley

tow the line
trials and tribulations
tried and true
two peas in a pod
upside down
uncle dick
under the weather
up the ante
up to par
vice versa

vis a vis
walk the plank
walk softly and carry a big stick
wax poetic
way to go
we was robbed

when it rains it pours
winner winner chicken dinner
wing it meaning
woot woot
woe is me
womp womp
wolf in sheep’s clothing
writ large
wrapped around your finger
wreak havoc
you are what you eat
you don’t say
you got me there
youth is wasted on the young
